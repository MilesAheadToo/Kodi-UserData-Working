But bands such as New York's Living Colour helped break down the doors by the end of the '80s, leading to a much more open-minded musical landscape that would eventually pave the way for future bands (Rage Against the Machine, Sevendust, etc.). The group (singer Corey Glover, guitarist Vernon Reid, bassist Muzz Skillings, and drummer Will Calhoun) first formed in the mid-'80s, with Reid being the only member with real prior band experience; he was a member of Ronald Shannon Jackson's experimental jazz outfit, and had recorded with Defunkt, Public Enemy, as well as issuing a solo album with Bill Frisell, 1984's Smash & Scatteration.\n\nIt took the fledgling band a few years for their sound to gel, as they honed their act at N.Y.C.'s famed CBGB's. But the group found an unlikely supporter in Mick Jagger, who took the band under his wing, produced a demo for the quartet, and helped them secure a record deal with Epic (just prior, Glover had to take a brief leave of absence from the band, as he landed a role in Oliver Stone's Vietnam War epic movie, Platoon). Living Colour's debut album, Vivid, was issued in the summer of 1988, yet it would take a few months for momentum to build. By the winter, the band's striking video for their anthem \"Cult of Personality\" was all over MTV, pushing Vivid to the upper reaches of the charts and to platinum certification. Living Colour also took home their first of several Grammy Awards, as \"Cult\" won Best Hard Rock Performance at the 1989 ceremony, and the band supported the release with a string of dates opening stadiums for the Rolling Stones' first U.S. tour in eight years that autumn.\n\nStarting with Vivid and continuing on future albums, the band showed that rock could still convey a message (as evidenced by such tracks as \"Open Letter to a Landlord,\" \"Funny Vibe,\" among others). The quartet regrouped a year later for their sophomore effort, Time's Up, an album that performed respectably on the charts but failed to live up to the expectations of their smash debut. An appearance at the inaugural Lollapalooza tour in the summer of 1991 kept the group in the public's eye, as did an EP of outtakes, Biscuits. Skillings left the group shortly thereafter (replaced by studio vet Doug Wimbish), as their darkest and most challenging release yet, Stain, was issued in 1993. Although it failed to sell as well as its predecessors, it retained the band's large and dedicated following, as Living Colour appeared to be entering an interesting and groundbreaking new musical phase of their career. The band began writing the following year for what would be their fourth full-length, but an inability to settle on a single musical direction caused friction between the members, leading to Living Colour's demise in early 1995.\n\nIn the wake of Living Colour's split, all of its former members pursued other projects. Reid issued a solo album, 1996's Mistaken Identity (as well as guesting on other artists recordings), while Glover attempted to launch a career as a solo artist, issuing the overlooked Hymns in 1998 and finding time to appear as a VJ on VH1 and acting in the 1996 movie Loose Women. Calhoun and Wimbish remained together and launched a new outfit, the drum'n'bass-inspired Jungle Funk, who issued a self-titled debut release in 1997 (Wimbish also issued a solo album, Trippy Notes for Bass, in 1999). With Living Colour out of commission for several years by the early 21st century, Calhoun and Wimbish teamed up once more with Glover in a new outfit, Headfake, playing often in the New York City area. A few days before Christmas in 2000, Headfake played a show at CBGB's, and were joined on-stage by Reid, which led to rumors of an impending Living Colour reunion. The rumors proved to be true, as Living Colour launched their first tour together in six years during the summer of 2001. In 2003, Living Colour returned with a deal with Sanctuary and their most experimental release to date, Collide\u00c3\u00b8scope. Two years later the rarities collection What's Your Favorite Color? was released, followed by Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour in 2006 and the all new Chair in the Doorway in 2009.", "strBiographyDE": null, "strBiographyFR": "Living Colour est un groupe de rock am\u00e9ricain fond\u00e9 en 1984 \u00e0 New York. La musique de Living Colour est une fusion de funk, de rock, de metal, de jazz et de rap, contenant des paroles qui attaquent la mentalit\u00e9 WASP et le racisme d'Am\u00e9rique. Le groupe fait partie du mouvement fusion qui s'est d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du milieu des ann\u00e9es 1980 avec Fishbone, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Faith No More, King's X, Jane's Addiction, etc., la principale influence du groupe restant les Bad Brains. Des titres comme Cult of Personality, Love Rears Its Ugly Head ou Leave It Alone sont embl\u00e9matiques du style de Living Colour.\n\nEn 1984, le guitariste Vernon Reid r\u00e9unit des musiciens d'exception pour former le groupe Living Colour : Will Cahloun a re\u00e7u le premier prix de percussion \u00e0 la Berklee School of Music de Boston, le bassiste Muzz Skillings est dipl\u00f4m\u00e9 de musicologie1. Le chanteur a tenu un r\u00f4le dans le film d'Oliver Stone Platoon. Ensemble, ils cr\u00e9ent une musique qui m\u00e9lange tous les styles sans se pr\u00e9occuper des cloisonnements musicaux: ils fusionnent rock, funk, heavy metal, reggae, punk, jazz, soul, rap, voire calypso ou zouk... Ils sont appuy\u00e9s par les membres des Rolling Stones, qui les emm\u00e8nent avec eux en tourn\u00e9e, et qui les invitent \u00e0 jouer sur leurs albums solos respectifs.\nVivid, leur premier album, coproduit par Mick Jagger, atteint la 6e place des charts am\u00e9ricains et est certifi\u00e9 deux fois disque de platine aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Leur tube Cult of Personality leur permet d'obtenir un Grammy Award pour la meilleure chanson hardrock en 1989. Ils re\u00e7oivent aussi le MTV Video Music Awards en tant que meilleur groupe la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\nL'album suivant, Time's Up, re\u00e7oit la collaboration de Little Richard et Carlos Santana. La chanson Love Rears Its Ugly Head est un succ\u00e8s. L'ann\u00e9e suivante para\u00eet un EP intitul\u00e9 Biscuits. En 1993, ils particip\u00e8rent \u00e0 la B.O. du film Judgment Night avec le groupe de rap Run-DMC.\nVernon Reid est sollicit\u00e9 de tous c\u00f4t\u00e9s, ce qui ent\u00e2me la coh\u00e9sion du groupe. Muzz Skillings quitte le navire, remplac\u00e9 par Doug Wimbish, qui a jou\u00e9 auparavant avec James Brown et George Clinton. Stain est leur dernier album. Le groupe se s\u00e9pare finalement au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 1995.

Cette tourn\u00e9e est suivie par la sortie d'un album, Collide\u00f8scope en 2003.\nIls ont particip\u00e9 au festival de Jazz de Montreux en 2007.
